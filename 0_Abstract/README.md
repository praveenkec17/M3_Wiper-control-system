## Introduction

Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe the raindrops or any water from the windscreen. Wipers are designed
and made to clear the water from a windscreen. Most of cars have two wipers on the windscreen, one on the rear
window and the other on each headlight. The wiper parts visible from outside the car are the rubber blade, the wiper
arm holding the blade, a spring linkage, and parts of the wiper pivots. The wiper itself has about six parts called
pressure points or claws that are small arms under the wiper

## Working

The working of the wiper is based on the conversion of the wiper
motors linear motion into linear back and forth movement of the
wiper blades. The wiper combines two mechanical technologies
to perform their tasks:
A combination of electric motor and worm gear reduction power
to the wipers and a neat linkage converts the rotational output of
the motor into the back and forth motion of the wiper.
Motor takes a lot of force to accelerate the wiper blades back and
forth across the windshield so quickly. In order to generate this
type of force, a worm gear is used on the output of a small
electric motor. The worm gear reduction can multiply the torque
of the motor by about 50 times and can slow it down with the
same force. The output of the gear reduction operates a linkage
that moves the wipers back and forth. Inside the motor/gear
assembly is the electronic circuit which senses the wipers are in
their down position. The circuit maintains power to the wipers
until they are parked at bottom of the windshield, and then cuts
the power to the motor. A short cam is attached to the output
shaft of the gear reduction. This cam spins around as the wiper
motor turns. The cam is connected to a long road; as the cam
spins, it moves the rod back and forth. The long rod is connected
to a short rod that actuates the wiper blade on the driver’s side.
Another long rod transmits the force from the driver’s side to the
passenger’s side wiper blade.
